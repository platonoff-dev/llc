# llc


llc (learning language compiler) is my own programming language implementation to learn how programming languages are built starting from lexing and up to compiler optimizations.

It not a compiled language yet it's interpreted language, and it doesn't support a lot of obvious things, but it will at some point.

It's supposed to be life-lasting project. I'll implement new features to it when I'll have inspiration and free time.
